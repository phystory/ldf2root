Before you compile the code, you may want to define $(ROOTLIB) and $(ROOTINCLUDE).
Or, you will meet errors whle you compile the code.

In Bash,
export ROOTLIB=<Your Root Library Directory>
export ROOTINCLUDE=<Your Root Include Directory>

In csh,
setenv ROOTLIB <Your Root Library Directory>
setenv ROOTINCLUDE <Your Root Include Directory>

Ex)
In Bash,
tonian@tonian:~/ldf2root_v4.0$ export ROOTLIB=/usr/lib/root
tonian@tonian:~/ldf2root_v4.0$ export ROOTINCLUDE=/usr/include/root

In csh,
tonian@tonian:~/ldf2root_v4.0$ setenv ROOTLIB /usr/lib/root
tonian@tonian:~/ldf2root_v4.0$ setenv ROOTINCLUDE /usr/include/root

Finally, you can make the program by typing as

make

You will have ldf2root.

Usage)
ldf2root PacFile EventFile [RootFileName StartBlock EndBlock]

Ex)
ldf2root ge80dp.pac alpha.ldf
ldf2root ge80dp.pac alpha.ldf alpha.root
ldf2root ge80dp.pac alpha.ldf alpha.root 1 100

Your ldf2root will also generate readroot.C file to provide a sample root code to analyze the converted root file.

Usage)
root readroot.C
or
root readroot.C++

In the root console, type ".ls" to see list of histograms.

Enjoy!
