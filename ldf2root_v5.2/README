Before you compile the code, you need to install the ROOT <https://root.cern.ch/> (Of course!!).
Or, you will meet errors whle you compile the code.

Install ROOT with an instruction linked below.
https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html

Finally, you can make the program by typing as

make

You will have ldf2root.

Usage)
ldf2root PacFile EventFile [RootFileName StartBlock EndBlock]

Ex)
ldf2root ge80dp.pac alpha.ldf
ldf2root ge80dp.pac alpha.ldf alpha.root
ldf2root ge80dp.pac alpha.ldf alpha.root 1 100

Your ldf2root will also generate readroot.C file to provide a sample root code to analyze the converted root file.

Usage)
root readroot.C
or
root readroot.C++

In the root console, type ".ls" to see list of histograms.

Enjoy!
